Requirements

Take the same problems as for lab 3, but instead of 2 matricx multiplication we must multiply 3 matrices in such a way that 
when a line in the first matrix is finished computed the mutliplication with the third matrix is triggered in a separate set of threads

 Synchronization used: No synchronization mechanism necessary since each thread works on a separate row (or rows) of the matrix.
 
 Performance comparison: 
  - system specifications: Windows PC with AMD CPU with 8 physical cores and 8 threads 
 
Square Matrix of size 700
